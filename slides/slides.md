Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: <br/>
Has not God **chosen** those who are

**poor** in the eyes of the world <br/>
to be **rich in faith**

and to inherit the **kingdom** <br/>
he promised those who **love** him?

---
<span class="ref">6</span>
But you have **dishonored** the poor. <br/>
Is it not the rich who are **exploiting** you?

Are they not the ones <br/>
who are dragging you into **court**?

<span class="ref">7</span>
Are they not the ones <br/>
who are **blaspheming** the noble name <br/>
of him to whom you belong?

---
<span class="ref">8</span>
If you really keep  <br/>
the **royal law** found in Scripture, <br/>
“**Love your neighbor** as yourself,” <br/>
you are doing right.

<span class="ref">9</span>
But if you show **favoritism**, <br/>
you **sin** and are convicted <br/>
by the law as **lawbreakers**.

and a **poor** man in **filthy** old clothes <br/>
also comes in.

The commandments, <br/>
“You shall not commit **adultery**,” <br/>
“You shall not **murder**,” “You shall not **steal**,” <br/>
“You shall not **covet**,” <br/>
and whatever other **command** there may be,

are summed up in this one command: <br/>
“**Love your neighbor as yourself**.”

Love does **no harm** to a neighbor. <br/>
Therefore love is the **fulfillment** of the law.
