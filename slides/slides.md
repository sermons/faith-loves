Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: <br/>
Has not God **chosen** those who are

**poor** in the eyes of the world <br/>
to be **rich in faith**

and to inherit the **kingdom** <br/>
he promised those who **love** him?

Is it not the rich who are **exploiting** you?

Are they not the ones <br/>

Are they not the ones <br/>
who are **blaspheming** the noble name <br/>
