Has not God **chosen** those who are

**poor** in the eyes of the world <br/>
to be **rich in faith**

and to inherit the **kingdom** <br/>
he promised those who **love** him?

But you have **dishonored** the poor. <br/>
Is it not the rich who are **exploiting** you?

Are they not the ones <br/>
who are dragging you into **court**?

<span class="ref">7</span>
Are they not the ones <br/>
who are **blaspheming** the noble name <br/>
of him to whom you belong?

If you really keep  <br/>
the **royal law** found in Scripture, <br/>
